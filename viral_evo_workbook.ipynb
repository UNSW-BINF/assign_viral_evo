    "How fast is the SARS-CoV-2 virus evolving? Can we empirically determine the speed of mutation? We can! Most biologists are very meticulous with their experiments and carefully document when samples are collected. We can then take a bunch of viral genomes, select a reference genome (usually the first known occurrence of the virus), and calculate the number of mutations from the reference to the remaining viral genomes. We can then use this information in conjunction with the sample collection dates to estimate how fast the viruses are evolving.\n",

As a hint, JC corrected and non-corrected genetic distance (ignoring indels) for SARS-CoV-2 sequences should be fairly similar and have the same unit.\n",

As such, SARS-CoV-2 is most likely the most well-documented and tracked virus of all time. Even five years ago, sequencing on this scale would have been impossible. This creates a problem when we want to compare the mutation rate with other viruses. We need reference viruses that have gone through a similar lifecycle to SARS-CoV-2 and need to be recent enough such that sufficient sequencing data is available to estimate the slopes correctly. Unfortunately for us (but thankfully for humanity), only a handful of viruses fit this description (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_epidemics). Additionally, some developing countries still need the technological or economic capability to carry out this kind of sequencing on a large scale, making reliable data challenging to come by. We have chosen the Ebola virus and Zika virus, as their sequencing data is more or less reliable and plentiful enough."

    "\n",
    "As the virus mutates, it inevitably evolves and proliferates around the world. Every so often, some mutations may prove especially beneficial to the spread of the virus, and this version of the virus spreads faster than other versions. When a version of a virus becomes especially prevalent inside a population, we call this a virus *variant*. Variants are nothing more than a naming scheme for viruses that have specific mutations. For instance, in Slovenia during 2022, we were dealing with the Omicron variant. Think of this as observing natural selection in real time. Some viruses have mutations that enable them to spread more easily throughout our population, which inevitably leads to the demise of other virus variants, which are not as good at proliferation. The result is survival of the fittest at the viral level, where, unfortunately, the fittest viruses seem to cause the most damage to us humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we identify variants? A variant is determined by several so-called *defining mutations*. Mutations can either be synonymous or nonsynonymous. Synonymous mutations are changes in nucleotide bases that result in the same encoded amino acid and are thus less important. Nonsynonymous mutations are nucleotide mutations that alter the amino acid sequence of a protein.\n",

If a sequence has no mutations throughout the whole genome compared to the reference, assign it to the *NO_MUTATIONS* class. Make sure to check for ALL mutations, not just the ones in the dictionary. If there is a tie, assign whichever variant. Save your answers to `problem4-classification.csv`. This file should contain two columns. The first column should indicate the accession id, e.g., *EPI_ISL_635200*, while the second column should indicate the variant display name (as specified in variants.json), e.g., *20I (Alpha, V1)* or *21K (Omicron)*. The CSV file should have no header. **[5 points]**\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have assigned all the sequences to a variant, create a plot showing the change in distribution over time. More concretely, we have given you up to 30 sequences per month. Calculate the percentage of each variant in each month, and plot the distribution over time. Your plots should resemble https://covariants.org/per-country, which you can use to validate your work. Note that your plot will probably have a lot of *UNKNOWN* viral assignments. Save your figure into `problem4.svg`. **[5 points]** \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use [`plt.stackplot`](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.stackplot.html) for plotting. You might also find the pandas [`Grouper`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.Grouper.html) class helpful when calculating percentages per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We will use a function `pd.read_csv(\"problem4-classification.csv\", sep=\",\", header=None)` to read your classification file, so you can test the correct format.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Due to the fast nature of the sequencing done in these sequences, some sequences may contain the character \"X\". This character does not denote some new amino acid but means that the sequencing was ambiguous and/or that the amino acid wasn't able to be determined. Ignore any positions with the \"X\" character, and do not count them toward mutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Although you could perform the alignment yourself with the algorithms you implemented in part 1, in this exercise, we have already pre-aligned the viral genomes for you to avoid any long-running computation. In this part, we will only consider substitutions and deletions, and we will ignore insertions. Insertions would needlessly complicate mutation indexing. Additionally, almost none of the variants for SARS-CoV-2 are determined by insertions, so we can ignore them.\n",

    "## Bonus 1: Kimura two-parameter correction (K2P)\n",

    "Kimura's two-parameter model is a more elaborate approach to correcting genetic distances. It assumes that transitions are four times more likely to occur than transversion, thus weighing those substitutions differently. The model still ignores insertions and deletions.\n",
