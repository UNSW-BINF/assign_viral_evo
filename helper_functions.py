def jukes_cantor(reference_sequence: str, distant_sequence: str) -> float:
    """The Jukes-Cantor correction for estimating genetic distances
    calculated with Hamming distance.
    Should return genetic distance with the same unit as if not corrected.

    Parameters
    ----------
    reference_sequence: str
        A string of nucleotides in a sequence used as a reference
        in an alignment with other (e.g. AGGT-GA)
    distant_sequence: str

        with a reference (e.g. AGC-AGA)

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The Jukes-Cantor corrected genetic distance using Hamming distance.
        For example 1.163.
